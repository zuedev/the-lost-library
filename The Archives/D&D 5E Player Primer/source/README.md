# zuedev's "Player Primer" for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition

Welcome to my "Player Primer" for Dungeons & Dragons! This guide intends to prepare new players for my D&D sessions and provide a reference for ongoing play. Keeping this page open during sessions is recommended when playing to help build good habits and keep me accountable.

Keep in mind that this guide assumes you have read **Chapters 7-10** from the **<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules" target="_blank">🐉 Basic Rules for D&D 5th Edition</a>**.
