# ‚öóÔ∏è Alchemy

The topic of Alchemy is barely touched upon in D&D, relegated to a simple check and some time. Let's make it more interesting! ü§ì

Althrough not nescessarily required, as all classes can _technically_ do alchemy, being an Alchemist (a subclass of Artificer) really does help.

## Alchemist Benefits

- All checks are done with advantage.
- Process is done in half the time.
- Level 10 Alchemists double their output.

## Potions & Poisons

To create either a potion or poison requires the following components:

- **Base:** Delivery method and detectability.
- **Agent(s):** Up to two can be used, each providing an effect.
  - If two of the same agent are used, they may have an additional effect! See the ingredients table below for "concentrated" effects.
- **Catalyst:** Save DC and metabolization period.

The mixing method that you choose to create the potion with affects the efficiency (how much is produced) and potency (how much healing/damage it does) of the product.
