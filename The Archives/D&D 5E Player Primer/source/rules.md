## Homebrew Rules

### Critical Initiative

Getting a critical success on initiative rolls changes their bonus action into a normal action for their first turn, whereas a critical fail restricts them to only movement or an action with no bonus actions.

### Lucky Feat Fix

You must declare the use of the Lucky feat before you roll and it grants advantage.

### Modified Help Action

- Characters must be proficient in activities they wish to help another character with.

### Potion Toxicity

If a player consumes more than one potion before finishing a long rest, they must make a Constitution saving throw after drinking it. The DC of the saving throw is equal to strength of the potion you drank. If you drink three or more potions before completing a long rest, you have disadvantage on this saving throw.

| Potion Rarity | Potion Toxicity DC |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Common        | 9                  |
| Uncommon      | 11                 |
| Rare          | 13                 |
| Very Rare     | 15                 |
| Legendary     | 17                 |

On a success, their body is able to withstand the residual magic from multiple potions mingling in their body. On a failure, the magic overpowers them. They feel queasy and vomit, taking acid damage equal to 1 + 1d8 per level of rarity of the potion and gain a toxicity effect. For example, a rare potion deals 3d8 + 1 acid damage and applies an effect from the Wild Magic Surge table.

### Special Actions

You can forgo your movement, bonus action, and reaction in a turn to do a special action instead, these are listed below:

- **Heavy Blow:** Gain advantage on one melee attack this turn.
- **Aimed Shot:** Aim for a specific point, such as a limb, for a specific desired effect.
- **Focused Casting:**
  - **Melee:** Gain advantage on one melee spell attack this turn.
  - **Ranged:** Aim for a specific point, such as a limb, for a specific desired effect.
  - **Saving throw:** Your spell save DC increases by +1.
- **Fully Digest Potion:** Instead of using a bonus action to drink a potion, you can use a special action to drink a potion and gain the full benefits of the potion instead of having to roll. For example, a potion of healing would heal you for the full amount of 10 instead of rolling 2d4 + 2.

### A Hero's End

When a character dies, they can choose to have a hero's end. This allows them to make a final special action before they die. This action cannot be used to heal themselves or save themselves from death. It can be used to save another character, deal a final blow to an enemy, or any other heroic action they wish to take. When they take this action, they waive rolling death saving throws and die at the end of their action.
